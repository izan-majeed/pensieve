Then, there is the practical example of the role of justice and fair play which inheres in the universe at God’s behest. The whole world surrounding the human being is based on these principles of balance and justice, which God wants human beings to follow; and this is clearly set forth in the Quran. The Quran is the verbal expression of this Divine justice and the universe is its practical expression. It is imperative that the subjects of God weigh their words and deeds in this balance. They should not be unjust in either giving or taking.</p>"

But human beings have been given special treatment by God in that they have been made of earth, or clay, which is an extremely rare thing in this extensive universe. In the whole universe the earth is a unique exception. Here, all the factors that are conducive to the existence, survival and cultural development of man have been provided in the most appropriate proportions and in the most balanced manner. One of these arrangements is the system of ‘two easts’ and ‘two wests’ on the earth. In winter, the places on the horizon where the sun rises and sets are different from those in summer. In this way, there is a range of ‘easts’ and ‘wests.’ This seasonal difference occurs due to the axial tilt of the earth in space. This tilt is a most unique feature, and man receives many natural advantages on account of this. The exceptional treatment of man and the earth in this universe is such a great manifestation of God’s grace and bounty that man is in no way capable of thanking his Creator sufficiently.</p>"

But, in spite of this complete freedom, no jinn or human being has the power to go beyond the limits of the universe. This fact itself is enough to prove that man is completely in the grip of God. On the expiry of the test period, when He starts seizing hold of people, it will not be possible for anybody to save himself.</p>"

But, acceptance at that time will be of no avail. Acceptance of God’s powers is valid only at the unseen stage and not after their open manifestation.</p>"
