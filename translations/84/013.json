    "translation": "If you wonder, then wondrous indeed is their saying, “Is it that, once we are dust, we are to be created anew?” They are those who have disbelieved in their Lord, and they are those who (shall) have shackles around their necks, and they are the people of the Fire. They shall remain there forever."

  {
    "verse_id": 6,
    "translation": "They ask for evil to come sooner than good, while punishments have really come to pass (against people) earlier to them. And surely, your Lord is the lord of forgiveness for the people against their wrongdoing, and surely, your Lord is severe in punishing."

And a similar scum comes up from what they melt in the fire to obtain ornaments or other objects. This is how Allah depicts the truth and the untruth.

  {
    "verse_id": 31,
    "translation": "And even if there were a Qur’ān wherewith the mountains could be moved, or the earth could be split apart, or wherewith the dead are spoken to, (they would not believe). In fact, every decision rests only with Allah. Are the believers not satisfied with the fact that, if Allah willed, He would have brought all the people to the right path?And the disbelievers are continually receiving affliction because of what they did, or it visits somewhere close to their homes, until Allah’s promise will come to pass. Surely, Allah does not go back upon His promise."

Is it that you are informing Him of something on earth He does not know, or of just empty words?” But, their ill- designs have been made alluring for the disbelievers, and they have been barred from the Path. And for the one whom Allah deprives of guidance, there is no one to guide."

    "verse_id": 34,
    "translation": "For them there is punishment in the worldly life, and indeed the punishment of the Hereafter is even harder, and for them there is none to save them from Allah."

    "verse_id": 35,
    "translation": "Here is the description of the Paradise promised to the God-fearing: underneath it the rivers flow; its food is everlasting and (so is) its shade. This is the ultimate abode of the God-fearing while the ultimate abode of the disbelievers is Fire."
